# Strategy Summary

With lambda expressions, there is no need to create additional classes for concrete strategies.

As a result, the following classes are not needed in functional programming:
* PersonalTaxPenalty.java
* PersonalTaxRebate.java
* PersonalTaxStrategy.java

The only thing required is to specify additional behavior using lambda expression in the main file.
